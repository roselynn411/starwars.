Basic webpage displaying items from the Star Wars API 


In this project we're going to retrieve the data to display on the page using JavaScript to fetch the data from the Star Wars API as needed. On the drop down button when you click on a character, its going to loop through StarWars Api to retrieve the film that the character was in.
